# Ghostlight<br/>
This game prototype was developed as part of a weekly student project within a game development training program. Each student group explores a different core mechanic inspired by modern AAA games but scaled down to fit a beginner-friendly scope using the Unity Engine (2D or 3D).<br/>
<br/>
The goal is to help students learn essential development workflows such as:<br/>
  -Scripting<br/>
  -Scene building<br/>
  -Asset integration<br/>
  -UI and UX basics<br/>
  -Simple game logic<br/>
<br/>
Each prototype features a unique gameplay twist (USP) and focuses on one specific mechanic or idea.<br/>
Inspired by: Phasmophobia / Luigi’s Mansion<br/>
Genre: 3D First-Person Horror<br/>
USP: Explore a haunted house with only a UV flashlight. Find hidden ghosts without triggering them.<br/>
Main focus: Light detection, ghost behavior, jump scare system.<br/>

<h1>Concept:</h1><br/>

<h2>Cyberpunk Setting</h2></br>
Scientists developed a system that allows humans to upload their consciousness into a global network, where they can either live in 
virtual realities and/or transfer themselves into humanoid robots.
<br/>
But the system was/is flawed, which led to some souls becoming twisted, going insane, etc. For example, when a person’s physical body 
dies but their consciousness remains "online," that consciousness eventually descends into madness, begins to glitch, causes errors, and 
starts attacking or infecting other users’ minds. Sometimes they even attempt to overwrite another person’s consciousness to regain a physical 
body.
<br/>
These souls that have succumbed to madness are now called "Ghosts."
<br/>
You are known as a Ghosthunter – a specialist in tracking and deleting "Ghosts" in the real world, since some souls have managed to possess 
the bodies of other humans.
<br/>
(Online-hunters will be available later as DLC or through minigames.)
<br/>
However, possessing a foreign body makes ghosts extremely sensitive to light.
<br/>
Superstition and desperation, aswell as hostile, intelligent ghosts led to the formation of ghostcults that force ghosts into (un)voluntary hosts. 
<br/>
In general possessed body owners want their physical body back unharmed. So caution and discretion is advised.
<br/>
<br/><br/>
<h2>Equipment</h2><br/>
To hunt ghosts in the real world, you are equipped with various gear that can generate light:
<br/>
Light Grenades – basically flashbangs<br/>

Light Pistols – fire concentrated light projectiles<br/>

Exo-suit – can refract light to become invisible for a limited time<br/>

Light Traps – temporarily immobilize possessed ghosts in place<br/>

Strobe Device – forces ghosts to exit their host bodies
<br/><br/>
<h2>Gameplay</h2><br/>
Upon receiving a certain amount of damage, the ghost dies, and the body becomes unconscious again.
<br/>
It is then transported to a clinic, provided the original consciousness is still online and hasn’t been corrupted.
<br/>
This is why speed is essential during hunts.
<br/>
Since ghosts are extremely sensitive to light, they naturally stay in dark places or only move at night.
<br/>
They destroy existing light sources and some even attempt to sabotage the power supply of entire cities.
<br/>
After receiving a hunting contract, you head to the house of the possessed individual to hunt the ghost or find clues to its whereabouts.
<br/>
Since ghosts can also manipulate electronic devices – depending on their strength and madness level – they can and will set traps to hinder 
you from finding or hunting them.
<br/>
Because they can manipulate various electronic systems, your light-based gadgets run on light energy, meaning you must regularly recharge 
your gear at functioning light sources.
<br/>
In earlier levels ghosts shouldn't be too difficult to find and familirize the player with core mechanics of the game: finding ghosts by following
environmental clues, talking with witnesses, expelling ghosts from bodies and destroy them.
<br/>
Stages with cultists and dangerous ghosts should give the player a fair challenge.
<br/>
Players should feel encouraged to learn different gameplay mechanics and aside from dread and horror, be rewarded for keen observation and
ressource management.
<br/>
<h3>Player</h3><br/>
The player has some ressources to keep in mind:<br/>
health, if a ghost is capable of inflicting physical harm.<br/>
Sanity, due to stress and harm by the ghosts<br/>
Energy, the entire equipment is powered by energy and essential for the hunt. Needs to be reloaded in order to succeed.
<br/>
Players move with a usual keyboard loadout, aiming with the mouse.<br/>
Controls via other means is yet to be determined, controller for PC is easy to implement<br/>
<h3>Enemies</h3>
For the start we focus on three classes of enemies:<br/>
"Ghouls" Weak ghosts, that can inhabit unconscious bodies or devices. Inprecise control of the body, should be an easier target.<br/>
"Cultists" Human opponents, if we choose to implement them, can serve a variety of purposes, ranging from exposition and distraction to 
hostile behaviour.<br/>
"Possessed" Ghosts that can switch between hosts quickly, can control their host good enough to pose a threat to the player. Make it more
difficult to keep harm from a host and to capture in general.<br/>
"Daemon" Boss, (can think of them leading an entire cult)<br/>
<br/><br/>
<h2>Leveldesign</h2><br/>
Since ghosts inhabit all manner of humans, we will find them in a variety of places like habitation hubs in poor and middle class neighbourhoods, 
rich peoples' mansions, factories and storage houses.
<br/>
Start with smaller homes in lower and middle class hubs. Small and crammed apartments, decives and spots for ghosts to hide in.
